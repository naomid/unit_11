	<p>Node.js is an open source server-side tool written in JavaScript. It's executed on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, making it incredibly fast and reliable. From what I understand, the most important feature of Node.js is that it blows the traditional request-response protocol out of the water. Instead of using the traditional protocol, Node.js uses a non-blocking and event-driven (I/O) paradigm. It allows the client and server to communicate freely by using a loop to exchange data. However, there are a few downsides. Node.js can't be used for operations requiring a lot of CPU. It's also single-threaded which makes things complicated.</p>
